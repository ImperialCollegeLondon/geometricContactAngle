# geometricContactAngle
Python toolkit for measuring contact angles in 3D porous media from segmented images.
The toolkit provides comprehensive contact angle analysis through two main workflows. The geometric measurement step (Main.py)  identifies three-phase contact lines and computes local contact angles, outputting detailed statistics including overall average contact angle, per-loop measurements, and individual point coordinates with angles. The spatial interpolation step (Main_SpatialInterpolation.py) transforms these discrete measurements into continuous 3D distributions, generating a complete contact angle field for every pore voxel, statistical visualizations showing angle distributions and wettability classifications, and metadata documenting the analysis parameters and results.
